## Strings

### Problem
Can you find the flag in this file without actually running it? You can also find the file in /problems/strings_4_40d221755b4a0b134c2a7a2e825ef95f on the shell server.

### Solution
Open the file as ASCII. Random unicode characters will appear.
Ctrl + F to find the flag (Search for "pico") (Why did only 5.6k teams solve this one?)
