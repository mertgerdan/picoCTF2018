## Admin Panel

**Problem**

We captured some traffic logging into the admin panel, can you find the password?

**Solution**

Traffic is in a .pcap file, which stands for "packet capture", and there are tools that can open these files. Wireshark is a good example.
Should be relatively straightforward after launching the file on Wireshark.
