## What's My Name?

### Problem
Say my name, say my name.

### Solution
Here we have a _myname.pcap_ file. Upon examining it, we see a DNS request from 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.12 for thisismyname.com

Destination IP's response sends a txt, which is: ```picoCTF{w4lt3r_wh1t3_d4946f5125fc315cfb62150b6e2aebe7}
