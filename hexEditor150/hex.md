## Hex Editor

### Problem
This cat has a secret to teach you. You can also find the file in /problems/hex-editor_0_8c20f979e6b2740dee597871ff1a74ee on the shell server.

### Solution
This obviously asks us to use a hex editor. I had EmEditor on my computer so upon opening that and ctrl+f'ing for "pico", I found the flag.
```picoCTF{and_thats_how_u_edit_hex_kittos_3E03e57d}```
